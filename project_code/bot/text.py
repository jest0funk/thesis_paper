It can chat and solve math tasks (someteimes correctly).

▪ By pressing a language button, you select certain language for further messaging or task solving.

▪ By pressing a 'Sample task...' button you select a language and send a sample task to the bot for solving. 
After getting the solution from the bot you can continue messaging or tasking in the same language.

▪ 'Toggle instruction visibility' turns on and off repeated prompt instructions in bot responses.

▪ 'Toggle funny messages' turns on and off the almost funny bot messages which are later replaced by model generated text. 
While simply chatting with no math tasks such bot exclamations may look weird.

▪ To quit to the menu when necessary, press the button at the bottom.

In case of bot freezing restart it by the /start command or just delete the whole chat and join it again.


Have fun! 🤩
